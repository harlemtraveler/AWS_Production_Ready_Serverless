STEPS:
1.) Customer places order - order_placed
2.) Notifies restaurant - restaurants_notified
3.) Restaurant accepts order - order_accepted
4.) Customer confirmation - user_notified
5.) Pick up - order_fulfilled


    • We can model these steps as Events, each representing a transition to a new state in our order flow, from:
        ◦ * “order_placed”
        ◦ * “restaurants_notified”
        ◦ * “order_accepted”
        ◦ * “user_notified”
        ◦ * “order_fulfilled"
