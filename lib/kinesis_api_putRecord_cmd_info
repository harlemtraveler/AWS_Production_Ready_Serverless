putRecord(params = {}, callback) ⇒ AWS.Request

Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call PutRecord to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.

You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.

The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.

The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs.

Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the ExplicitHashKey parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

PutRecord returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.

Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the SequenceNumberForOrdering parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

If a PutRecord request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, PutRecord throws ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.

By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod or DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to modify this retention period.

Examples:

Calling the putRecord operation

var params = {
  Data: Buffer.from('...') || 'STRING_VALUE' /* Strings will be Base-64 encoded on your behalf */, /* required */
  PartitionKey: 'STRING_VALUE', /* required */
  StreamName: 'STRING_VALUE', /* required */
  ExplicitHashKey: 'STRING_VALUE',
  SequenceNumberForOrdering: 'STRING_VALUE'
};
kinesis.putRecord(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err) console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred
  else     console.log(data);           // successful response
});

Parameters:

    params (Object) (defaults to: {}) —
        StreamName — (String)

        The name of the stream to put the data record into.
        Data — (Buffer, Typed Array, Blob, String)

        The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must not exceed the maximum record size (1 MB).
        PartitionKey — (String)

        Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream.
        ExplicitHashKey — (String)

        The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.
        SequenceNumberForOrdering — (String)

        Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the SequenceNumberForOrdering of record n to the sequence number of record n-1 (as returned in the result when putting record n-1). If this parameter is not set, records are coarsely ordered based on arrival time.

Callback (callback):

    function(err, data) { ... }

    Called when a response from the service is returned. If a callback is not supplied, you must call AWS.Request.send() on the returned request object to initiate the request.

    Context (this):
        (AWS.Response) —

        the response object containing error, data properties, and the original request object.

    Parameters:
        err (Error) —

        the error object returned from the request. Set to null if the request is successful.
        data (Object) —

        the de-serialized data returned from the request. Set to null if a request error occurs. The data object has the following properties:
            ShardId — (String)

            The shard ID of the shard where the data record was placed.
            SequenceNumber — (String)

            The sequence number identifier that was assigned to the put data record. The sequence number for the record is unique across all records in the stream. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record put into the stream.
            EncryptionType — (String)

            The encryption type to use on the record. This parameter can be one of the following values:

                NONE: Do not encrypt the records in the stream.

                KMS: Use server-side encryption on the records in the stream using a customer-managed AWS KMS key.
            Possible values include:
                "NONE"
                "KMS"

Returns:

    (AWS.Request) —

    a handle to the operation request for subsequent event callback registration.
